.SH NAME
sigmet_raw \- access Sigmet raw product volumes
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\fBsigmet_raw\fP \fBvolume_headers\fP \fIraw_volume\fP

\fBsigmet_raw\fP \fBdata\fP \fIraw_volume\fP

.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBsigmet_raw\fP application reads and prints information
from Sigmet raw product volumes.
.TP
\fBsigmet_raw\fP \fBvolume_headers\fP \fIraw_volume\fP
Reads and prints volume headers from \fIraw_volume\fP, which
must be a Sigmet raw product file. A \fB-\fP denotes standard
input.  Ray headers and data are not printed.  Output lines
have form:
.sp 1
.ti +4
\fIvalue\fP \fB|\fP \fIhierarchy\fP \fB|\fP \fIdescriptor\fP
.sp 1
In this context, \fIhierarchy\fP refers to the Sigmet data
structures that contain the member.  For a hierarchy with two
levels, it would look like
.sp 1
.ti +4
\fI<struct1>.<struct2>.member\fP.
.sp 1
Be aware that the same member might reside in several structure
hierarchies.  See the IRIS Programmers Manual for details.
.TP
\fBsigmet_raw\fP \fBray_headers\fP \fIraw_volume\fP
Reads and prints ray times, azimuths, and tilts from
\fIraw_volume\fP, which must be a Sigmet raw product file.
A \fB-\fP denotes standard.  input.  Volume headers and data
are not printed.
.TP
\fBsigmet_raw\fP \fBdata\fP \fIraw_volume\fP
Reads and prints ray headers and  data from \fIraw_volume\fP, which
must be a Sigmet raw product file. A \fB-\fP denotes standard input.
Volume headers are not printed.
