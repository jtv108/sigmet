This directory provides source code, scripts, and documentation for
programs that access Sigmet data, i.e. data produced by Sigmet RVP
signal processors.

To build the applications:
cd src
(Edit the Makefile)
make
make install
or
make install PREFIX=_some_other_dir_

src has source code for the applications.

    The binary applications are:

    sigmet_hdr		- prints headers from Sigmet raw product files.
			  This application prints information about when
			  the file were recorded, the geometry of the data
			  (number of sweeps, rays, bins), and other information.
			  See sigmet_hdr (1) for details.
    sigmet_raw		- Reads a Sigmet raw product volume and provides
   			  information about it, and manipulates it, as ordered by
			  commands read from standard input or a file.
			  See sigmet_raw (1) for more information.
    sig_raw		- sends a command to a sigmet_raw process running as
    			  a daemon, and prints the result.
    sigmet_good		- determines if a sigmet raw volume is readable.
    geog		- does cartographic calculations. See geog (1).
    tm_calc		- does time calculations. See tm_calc (1).
    hsv			- converts hue/saturation/value color specifiers to
			  red/green/blue. See hsv (1).
    bighi,
    biglo,
    biglrg,
    bigsml		- print value ranges with various spacings between the
    			  values. Helps make color tables. See bighi (1),
			  biglo (1), biglrg (1).
    color_legend	- prints SVG code for a color legend.

    The following auxilliary scripts help access, manipulate, and display Sigmet
    raw volumes.  See the internal documentation for details on usage and hints
    on how to modify them for other uses.

    sigmet_dorade	- produces DORADE sweep files for a Sigmet raw product
			  volume. Computes receiver power.
    sigmet_mkcase.awk	- generates commands to copy or link a set of raw volumes
    			  to set of directories, one directory per case. A case
			  is a consecutive sequence of volumes.
    utm_zone		- computes the UTM zone that contains a given longitude.
    sigmet_sizex.awk	- estimates the amount of memory a sigmet_raw daemon will
			  need.
    sigmet_svg		- generates svg code for a sigmet sweep.
    sigmet_svg.js	- make sigmet_svg image interactive.
    sigmet_vol_tm	- reformats volume names so that time information can be
			  manipulated.
    sigmet_fdupes	- searches current directory for duplicate Sigmet volumes.
    raster_clrs		- prints a set of data ranges and color values.
    pisa		- creates a SVG document with a Cartesian plot.
